# School Project: Discord Role Management Bot

## Description

This Discord bot was created as part of a programming project for a school programming class. The bot is designed to manage roles in a Discord server by allowing users to assign and remove specific roles using reactions to designated messages.

## Features

- **Role Assignment:** Users can assign themselves specific roles by reacting to designated messages with emojis.
- **Role Removal:** Users can also remove assigned roles by removing their reactions from the designated messages.
- **Intuitive Interface:** The bot uses emojis associated with different roles, making it easy for users to interact with and manage their roles.
- **Customizable:** The roles and emojis are customizable and can be adjusted to suit the needs of the Discord server.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the code files to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   pip install discord.py
4. Create a file named token.txt in the same directory as the code and paste your Discord bot token inside the file.

5. invite the bot to your Discord server by generating an OAuth2 URL with the appropriate permissions and adding it to your server.

## Usage
You can customize the code by updating the emojis and role names according to your Discord server's setup.

Run the bot script by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install discord.py  
```
The bot will now be active on your server. Users can interact with it by reacting to the designated messages with the corresponding emojis to assign or remove roles.

## Example
Reacting to the message with a ðŸŽ² emoji will assign the user the "Gaming" role.
Removing the ðŸŽ² emoji reaction will remove the "Gaming" role from the user.
